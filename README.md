Mobile Experience Building Assignment for CIS4930 (Enterprise Software Engineering Practices) at the University of Florida

Part 1: Using any online mocking tools (see resources section for some free ones) or free-hand drawing if you believe it will be neat enough for us to grade, design the W-2 form below to be a mobile app experience.
- Assume that an employee is using their mobile device to input this information based on the W-2 form they received from their employer.
- You must break it down into at least 6 separate screens:
  - Start screen (with any relevant text about what the user is about to “start”)
  - 4 or more input screens (you want to split up the input fields in a way that is intuitive and the least overwhelming to the user)
  - Submit screen (with the option to go back and fix fields)

Part 2: Testing for Accessibility
- Review the accessibility resources below and select at least 2 distinct checks that should be applied to your mobile experience.
- Think of this as writing requirements for an engineer who would be developing this experience.
  - For example, if there was an image on the screen, one distinct check might be “The image of the IRS logo must have descriptive text of ‘IRS Logo’ added as alt-text”
Note: “Distinct” in this context means they are not in the same category. If you create a check for 2 different images that both need descriptive text, that counts as 1 distinct check, not 2.
